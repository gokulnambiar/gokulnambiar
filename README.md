##ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gokul - a Data & AI professional with a Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and experience across analytics, backend development, and applied machine learning.

Iâ€™ve worked on building scalable data pipelines, forecasting models, and dashboarding at Daimler Buses, and built production-grade backend tools at Ingram Micro. My project portfolio spans transformer-based NLP, GANs for image enhancement, and structured ML workflows with tools like PySpark, DBT, and Azure Databricks.

Currently exploring efficient deep learning, and multimodal systems â€” with a strong focus on building interpretable, deployment-ready ML solutions.
