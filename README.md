## 👋 Hi, I’m Gokul

I'm a **Data & AI professional** with a **Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** and experience across analytics, backend development, and applied machine learning.

- 🚌 At **Daimler Buses**, I built **scalable data pipelines**, **forecasting models**, and **KPI dashboards** to support fleet analytics.
- 🖥️ Previously at **Ingram Micro**, I developed **production-grade backend tools** and integrated systems following software engineering best practices.


🚀 Currently, I’m exploring **deep learning**, **agentic** and **multimodal systems**, with a strong focus on **interpretable, deployment-ready ML solutions**.
